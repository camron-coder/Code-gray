# Areas of the hospital

A hospital is pretty large so it will have many different areas but here's some that I've been brainstroming about and the kind of gameplay that will happen there.

## - Lobby/waiting area

### Narrative 
 Every hospital needs an area to seat waiting patients and check them in so of course there’s going to be a waiting/lobby area .

### Gameplay 
The player starting room is going to be pretty close to the lobby area. Here they’ll see just how the destruction is. They will as find out that they’re trapped in the hospital here because the doors will be covered in human skins. There will be an enemy encounter here that will cause them to awaken their powers.

## -Lunchroom

### Narrative
People need to eat and so there needs to be a lunchroom for them to eat in.

### Gameplay
This room will be part of one of the arch demons territories. It will be filled with gluttonous souls and demonic beings. 

## -Sugery room 

### Narrative
There needs to be a place where surgery’s can performed in a hospital.

### Gameplay
The player will walk into the room where they will see “surgeons” working on somebody but they’re actually just killing the person on the table. The player will then fight the surgeons who can cut with surgical precision.
